<div id="everyone" class="section level2">
<h2>Everyone</h2>
<div id="big-picture" class="section level3">
<h3>Big Picture</h3>
<p>We expect everyone to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be supportive</strong> - We’re all in this together!<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Share your knowledge.</strong> Mentorship takes many forms, but frequently involves looking out for those who are more junior to us. If you’ve done something before, share your experience. We are a team and we should work together.</li>
<li><strong>Be engaged in the community.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Attend and actively engage in lab and one-on-one meetings. Ask questions, make suggestions, etc. If you are easily distracted by technology, disconnect during lab meetings.<br />
</li>
<li>Attend talks in the CVL, BBS, and greater UTD community.<br />
</li>
<li>Be an positive representative and advocate for our lab and our lab’s work in our larger research communities.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be independent when possible, ask for help when necessary. Specifically, ask three, then me!
<ul>
<li>There are lots of great resources on the web you should consult - StackOverflow, NeuroStars, etc<br />
</li>
<li>Use others in the lab (and in the CVL, BBS) and external collaborators.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Communicate honestly</strong>, even when it’s difficult.<br />
</li>
<li>Do work we are proud of individually and as a group.
<ul>
<li>Double check your work.<br />
</li>
<li>Our lab has a commitment to open science. Be ready to share your work both within the lab and with outsides at the conclusion of a project.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Work towards proficiency in Unix, BASH, R, and Python.</li>
<li>Respect each other’s strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs.
<ul>
<li>Be patient with everyone (including the Lab Director). Most of us are learning new skills and are busier than we would like.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adhere to the ethical principles as described by the <a href="https://www.apa.org/ethics/code/">Association for Psychological Science</a>, <a href="https://www.sfn.org/Membership/Professional-Conduct/SfN-Ethics-Policy">Society for Neuroscience</a>, and <a href="https://research.utdallas.edu/orio/rcr">UT Dallas Responsible Conduct of Research</a>.</li>
<li>Maintain a professional and accurate online presence. Make sure you keep your online profiles up to date. Remember, we all represent the lab and the lab represents us.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="small-picture" class="section level3">
<h3>Small Picture</h3>
<p>We’re sharing a relatively small space, so please be thoughtful of others. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not come into the lab if you are sick!</strong> It’s better to keep everyone healthy. If you are sick, email your direct supervisor (see organization chart).<br />
</li>
<li>Keep the lab neat.
<ul>
<li>Do not leave food, drinks, or crumbs in the lab.<br />
</li>
<li>Items left unattended may be cleaned, reclaimed or recycled.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>University policies</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div id="lab-director" class="section level2">
<h2>Lab Director</h2>
<p>As the lab director, you can expect me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a vision for where the lab is going, both in the short-term (next few weeks) and in the long-term (next few years).</li>
<li>Obtain funding to support our laboratory.<br />
</li>
<li>Care about your happiness.</li>
<li>Support your career development, including:
<ul>
<li>writing recommendation letters,<br />
</li>
<li>introducing you to other scientists (potential future mentors and colleagues),<br />
</li>
<li>promoting your work as often as possible (at conferences),<br />
</li>
<li>facilitating conference travel (see position-dependent specifics below), and<br />
</li>
<li>working with mentees (Postdocs, Mentees) to create an Individual Development Plan (IDP).<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Support your personal development, including:
<ul>
<li>flexible working hours and environment (when feasible), and<br />
</li>
<li>encouraging activities outside of school/work.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make the time to meet with you regularly, read and provide feedback on code, posters, manuscripts, and other data products.</li>
<li>Obsess over chosing the correct analyses, clear phrasing, and awesome data visualizations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="employees" class="section level2">
<h2>Employees</h2>
<p><strong>Add employee expectations here.</strong></p>
<div id="lab-manager" class="section level3">
<h3>Lab Manager</h3>
<ul>
<li>Check the voicemail daily and arrange for return calls to be made within one business day.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="post-bacc-research-assistants" class="section level3">
<h3>Post-bacc Research Assistants</h3>
</div>
<div id="postdocs-and-staff-scientists" class="section level3">
<h3>Postdocs and Staff Scientists</h3>
<p>I will expect postdocs and staff scientists to move towards being more PI-like, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>giving conference talks,<br />
</li>
<li>writing grant proposals, and<br />
</li>
<li>cultivating an independent research program (up to 10% of time).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, to have (or acquire) the technical and open science skills listed for PhD students below.</p>
<p>Postdoc salaries generally follow <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/salary-cap-and-stipend-levels-announced">NIH guidelines</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="students" class="section level2">
<h2>Students</h2>
<p><strong>Add expectations for students here.</strong></p>
<div id="phd-students" class="section level3">
<h3>PhD Students</h3>
<p>I will expect graduate students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>attend classes, colloquium, and relevant talks around campus,<br />
</li>
<li>be <strong>excited</strong> about the research questions they are asking, be <strong>eager</strong> to find the answers, and <strong>anxious</strong> to share their results with others,<br />
</li>
<li>seek out and apply for fellowships and awards (including travel awards), and<br />
</li>
<li>realize there are times for pulling all-nighters and times for smelling the roses.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will expect graduate students to move towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>expertise in their chosen field(s) by knowing the literature like the back of their hand (see below for suggestions on how to do this),</li>
<li>proficiency in using R and/or Python for data analysis and model fitting,</li>
<li>writing BASH shell scripts for imaging analysis in FSL,</li>
<li>sharing your work with me (and others) using R Markdown and/or Jupyter notebooks,</li>
<li>preregistering their experiments publicly on OSF,</li>
<li>sharing their data and scripts publicly on OSF and/or GitHub,</li>
<li>making figures and posters using R or Python along with Adobe Illustrator,</li>
<li>clearly communicating your results in written and verbal formats, and</li>
<li>actively mentoring those working for them (undergraduate RAs), including completing an Individual Development Plan (IDP).</li>
</ul>
<p>The learning curve for these skills can be steep, but developing these skills is necessary for success in both cognitive neuroscience and data science. If these goals do not align with your own interests and goals, then my lab is probably not a good fit for you.</p>
<p><strong>Add UTD-specific info here.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="masters-students" class="section level3">
<h3>Master’s Students</h3>
<p>I will expect Master’s students to move towards being more PhD student-like. In particular, by the end of their time in the lab, I expect students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete an empirical study in the lab, and</li>
<li>complete a poster and/or written manuscript of that study.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="undergraduate-students" class="section level3">
<h3>Undergraduate Students</h3>
<p>Undergraduate students will play a vital role in our lab. Students can be involved in the lab in a number of ways, including independent study projects, student works, and internships. Given that we have limited time and resources, unfortunately we cannot accept or keep all undergraduates who are interested in our lab. Based on the lab’s needs, we will consider new undergraduates at the beginning of each term. Each new undergraduate must attend a manditory orientation session, journal club, and serve a probationary term (one semester) before advancing further in the lab.</p>
<p>I expect undergraduates to be utterly reliable and willing to help with whatever projects need it. At a bare minimum, reliabillity includes showing up on time, maintaining your hours on the lab calendar, and making sure all of your work is accurate (double-check everything). In most cases, undergraduates will be directly mentored by the lab manager for their first semester in the lab, and then move on to work directly with a research assistant or graduate student.</p>
<hr />

</div>
<div id="communication" class="section level1">
<h1>Communication</h1>
<p>Communication is critical. Whether you persue academia or industry, you will need to be able to communicate with others about your work.</p>
<div id="communication-within-the-lab" class="section level2">
<h2>Communication within the lab</h2>
<div id="lab-meetings" class="section level3">
<h3>Lab Meetings</h3>
<p>Regular lab meetings are essential for making sure that we move both current and future projects forward. They also help us function as a team. We will use lab meetings to discuss administrative and practical issues, solicit feedback on current analyses and code, discuss current literature, and practice conference and job talks. Our weekly lab meetings will run approximately 1-1.5 hours long. All full-time staff and graduate students will be expected to attend (unless cleared with the Lab Director in advance).</p>
<p>During lab meetings, one or two presenters will be responsible for setting the agenda that day. The presenter/s will also be responsible for sharing any relevant materials (e.g. journal article) a couple of days in advance. If you’re scheduled to present and need to cancel or postpone, please give the group 72 hours notice. <strong>Everyone is expected to participate in lab meetings.</strong> That means reading relevant material beforehand and if you are easily distracted by your computer or phone, put it away.</p>
</div>
<div id="individual-meetings" class="section level3">
<h3>Individual Meetings</h3>
<p>All managers should have weekly meetings with their mentees, lasting between 15 minutes to an hour. For instance, as lab director, I will have weekly meetings with the lab manager, postdocs, staff scientists, and any students leading projects. Ideally, the agenda for these meetings should be set by the mentee; you should provide a quick overview of the progress you’ve made on your project and let your mentor know where you’re stuck and/or need help. You can also use individual meetings to seek feedback about new project development or professional development</p>
</div>
<div id="asana" class="section level3">
<h3>Asana</h3>
<p>Asana is a project-management platform that we will use to track progress on various projects in the lab.</p>
<ul>
<li>Asana is basically an orgnaized to-do list. When adding a task, make sure to put a useful description, assign it to someone and set a tentative due date.<br />
</li>
<li>Be realistic and flexible with due dates. Of course you should try to get things done in a timely manner, but sometimes, life happens and you have to adjust.<br />
</li>
<li>If you’re leading a project in the lab, please make sure that your project is listed on Asana. All project-related tasks should be under your project.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="slack" class="section level3">
<h3>Slack</h3>
<p>Slack is a team-collaboration tool that we will use for communication.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to avoid direct messages in Slack. Instead, find a home for your comment or question in an existing channel. This allowsyou to get answers and feedback from multiple people in the lab.<br />
</li>
<li>When replying to a question or comment, try to use threads. This keeps the conversation organized and easy to navigate.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="email" class="section level3">
<h3>Email</h3>
<p>When contacting me, please use Slack (or Asana) whenever possible. I will try to respond to emails, but please don’t use it for anything urgent.</p>
<p>Likewise, I will try to use Asana/Slack to communicate with you as much as possible. However, sometimes I will need to email you. <strong>I expect you will read all email sent to you and respond (if a response is needed) within one business day.</strong> If you will not be checking email for more than a couple of days, please consider using a vacation message so that others know you are not available on email (this suggestion also applies to holidays).</p>
<p>The same guideline applies to me: if I don’t respond within one business day, please feel free to follow up (but consider using Slack). If I am not available, I will put up a vacation message.</p>
</div>
<div id="calendars" class="section level3">
<h3>Calendars</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div id="communication-outside-the-lab" class="section level2">
<h2>Communication outside the lab</h2>
<div id="phone" class="section level3">
<h3>Phone</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If the phone rings in the lab, answer it. Most calls will be from potential (or current) research participants, so it is important to be professional - e.g., “Aging Well Lab, this is [your name]. How may I help you?”</p></li>
<li><p>Lab policy is to check the voicemail daily and call back within one business day.</p></li>
<li><p>Please see the lab wiki for specific on speaking to potential research participants.</p></li>
